                <article>
                    <div class="content-1170 center-relative">
                        <img title="" src="images/disb/disb-home-hero.png" alt="">
                        <p><small><strong>Note:</strong> A Disbursement is the industry term for a payment of money from a fund.</small></p>
                        <p>If you file an insurance claim, there is an overwhelming chance that it will be paid via a mailed check. If you are in a situation where you need funds immediately, like if your home is damaged by fire and you need to stay at a hotel immediatly, the wait to receive a check is not a good experience. To provide the best experience for their customers, and innovate within the insurance industry, Farmer’s insurance partnered with Paymentus to create an instant disbursements solution.</p>

                        <div class="one_half">
                            <h4>My Role</h4>
                            <p>As lead product designer, I managed the requirements gathering, discovery and design, as well as product management during the development of the application.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="one_half last">
                            <h4>Goal</h4>
                            <p>To create a way to send digital funds as quickly and easily as possible to a user, with the understanding that they may be experiencing a time of crisis.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4 class="clear">Requirements & Considerations</h4>
                        <p>The application must be web based and work on both mobile and desktop. The interface should also be themeable since subsidiaries of Farmer’s will utilize it. Additionally, an agent management interface will also need to be developed.</p>

                        <h4>Requirements Gathering and Discovery</h4>
                        <p>I was not able to find any examples of digital disbursements being used currently in the insurance industry. Sending funds peer to peer is becoming very common, and many solutions exist (paypal, venmo, cash app, zelle). But these solutions are not business-to-consumer don’t carry the same legal and regulatory restrictions that the insurance industry must adhere to.</p>
                        <p>There is also the issue of identity. If I send money to the wrong person via Paypal, it’s not Paypal’s problem. But what if your insurance company sends the wrong person the money to replace your vehicle? When you deposit a check at your bank, you have already established your identity when you created your account. When receiving digital funds from a company, additional care must be taken to ensure that the correct person is receiving them. The proposed solution must be secure and trustworthy, yet still be quick and easy to use.</p>
                        <p>I interviewed multiple insurance professionals to gather additional information on how the disbursement process currently works, especially what can go wrong. I also got their feedback on my proposed solutions as I worked through the design.</p>

                        <h4>Creating the User Flow</h4>
                        <p>Here’s the basics of how the app would flow:</p>

                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="screenshot">
                        <div class="one_half">
                            <ol>
                                <li>User files an insurance claim (via phone call).</li>
                                <li>An agent/adjuster would create a disbursement in the admin application.</li>
                                <li>User would receive an email or text with URL to the payment portal.</li>
                                <li>User answers security question(s).</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>

                        <div class="one_half last">

                            <h4>Responsive Mobile</h4>
                            <p>Discovery and user interviews confirmed that users would need to access thier disbursements on mobile. The purpose of the disbursements portal is to increase the time from approved claim to funds being received. Users could potentially be in situations where they could be stranded and need immediate financial assistance. If your house is flooding and you need a hotel room, or if your car is totalled and you need a rental - waiting on a check isn't going to cut it. It was a primary foche mobile experience must be easy, fast &amp; secure.</p>

                        <h4>Admin Portal</h4>
                        <p>There was also the need for a robust admin application. This would provide for the claims adjuster to create, edit, &amp; void disbursements. The admin portal would need history and reporting capibilites for regulatory and compliance purposes. The status of disbursements would need overtly displayed for when errors or any support issues arise. The admin portal is also designed to be embedded in Farmer's internal managment site.</p>

                        <img class="screenshot" title="" src="images/disb/disb-home.png" alt="">
                        <p>Insurance companies already have software for creating and managing claims, but these usually end at the payment step. Our system would need to sit in between the claims management system and the check printing and mailing system. Also, if a digital disbursement was not claimed within a certain amount of time, it would be canceled and a check would be mailed. Regulations require that funds be disbursed by certain dates that claims are approved. The user would be notified what was going on as well.</p>
